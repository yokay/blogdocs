# An Introduction to Biopotential Measurement Challenges

In this new precision low power blog series, we will take a deep dive into the challenges of making biopotential measurements. We will also  address some of the common topics that frequently come up, such as:

- Designing a precision low power signal chain that maximizes battery life
- Measuring small signals in the presence of various interferers
- Understanding electrodes and difficulties making good contact with dry electrodes
- Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) and Right Leg Drive (RLD)
- Implementing electrode/lead-off detection

The first bullet is an important one to highlight and is not limited  to healthcare wearables. Applications such as environmental monitoring,  field instruments (electromagnetic flow, level, pressure, and  temperature sensing), electrochemical gas sensing, and pH measurement  can all require precision at low power. So, what makes this  challenging? Going from higher voltage bipolar supplies to a single  3.3V or 1.8V supply greatly reduces the amount of headroom available and limits the gain you can apply. Battery-powered applications are  typically space-constrained, so PCB area is at a premium. Additionally, tradeoffs between power, noise, bandwidth, and measurement sample rates must be considered.

Low power designs need a system level approach to truly optimize  battery life. Fortunately, Analog Devices is providing recommendations, tools, and support for [complete precision low power signal chains](https://www.analog.com/en/applications/technology/precision-technology/precision-low-power.html) to assist with this. 

## Why Biopotentials?

The lines between fitness-based wearables and healthcare technology  continue to blur with the introduction of products that can detect  atrial fibrillation (AFib) and even sleep apnea. The past two years  have further emphasized the need and urgency for medical-grade devices  that can monitor the health of patients in the home, enable early  detection and prevention of diseases, reduce costs, and communicate with doctors remotely. Biopotential measurements can further be leveraged in a variety of other applications such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), authenticating user identity, or even [controlling a prosthetic limb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HWmEpsNwYU).  Regardless of the application, the challenges of acquiring these  signals remain the same, and this series will aim to address the pain  points in your design.

## Biopotential Overview

Biopotentials are electrical signals generated by the electrochemical activity of various cells within the body. When these cells are  stimulated, an action potential is produced. Action potentials are a  way of transferring information between adjacent cells, and the  accumulation of these can result in biopotentials typically measured.  Figure 2 shows the electrical activity within the heart and the more  recognizable ECG biopotential signal that can be measured with  electrodes on the skin. This [3D Heart Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIuIo9dbX88) explains this in more detail.

The difficulty with measuring these biopotentials is the presence of  other undesired interferers. DC to low frequency can contain large  offsets due to the electrode half-cell potential and electrode mismatch, slow-moving baseline wander, 1/F noise, and motion artifacts. Note  that these signals are **not common mode** and appear in  series with the biopotential signal. At higher frequencies, the common  mode signal to worry about is the 50/60Hz from the AC mains. Sometimes  other biopotentials can even be an interferer such as EMG when measuring ECG or ECG when measuring EEG. Figure 3 shows the overlapping  frequency ranges of these biopotentials and interferers.

In the next blog, we’ll discuss how to design a signal chain to  measure biopotentials while managing interferers, including AC and DC  coupled solutions.
