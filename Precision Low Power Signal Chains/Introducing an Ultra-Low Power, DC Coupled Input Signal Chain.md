#  Introducing an Ultra-Low Power, DC Coupled Input Signal Chain

Now that we gave an AC coupled example ([AD8233](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad8233.html)) in our [previous blog post](https://ez.analog.com/ez-blogs/b/engineerzone-spotlight/posts/precision-low-power-signal-chains-a-unique-ac-coupled-solution-with-configurability), the recent release of the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) is a great opportunity to discuss a DC coupled input signal chain. If you recall in the [second blog](https://ez.analog.com/ez-blogs/b/engineerzone-spotlight/posts/precision-low-power-signal-chains-to-ac-or-not-to-ac-couple-that-is-the-question), we mentioned that DC coupled signal chains dealing with large sensor  offsets require higher resolution ADCs that typically burn more power  and take additional board area. 

With the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) shown in Figure 1 you have an unparalleled depth of signal chain  integration in ADI’s unique architecture, which delivers a 24-bit  Sigma-Delta ADC complete with integrated Programmable Gain Amplifier  (PGA) and FIFO at an impressive 32uA quiescent current in continuous  conversion mode. Having a supply voltage range of 1.71-3.6V and a tiny  2.7mm x 3.56mm WLCSP footprint, the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) is ideal for battery powered applications such as field instruments,  smart transmitters, and wireless sensor nodes, where temperature and  bridge (pressure, load, strain) based sensors are supported.  Additionally, the integrated crosspoint multiplexer brings added  flexibility by enabling a measurement channel between any pair of the 16 analog inputs.

## Low Power at the System Level

When describing precision low power signal chains in the [first blog](https://ez.analog.com/ez-blogs/b/engineerzone-spotlight/posts/precision-low-power-intro-to-biopotentials), we mentioned a system level approach is needed to truly optimize battery life. The [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) does just that by incorporating features that consider the power of the complete solution from the sensor to the microcontroller. Let’s first  think about a typical 1kΩ bridge sensor biased at a 3V reference  voltage. This alone burns 3mA which is already ~100X more than the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) that is measuring it! To remove this power “hotspot”, the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) includes a low-side power switch (see Figure 2) that may be used to  power down the bridge sensor between conversions. This low-side switch  is controlled by the smart channel sequencer to tailor timing and  optimize energy savings. Another option to consider for power sensitive applications would be to bias the bridge sensor with an excitation  current instead of a voltage reference. The [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) includes register programmable, precision excitation current sources  that range from 100nA to 200uA and can be driven off chip through any of the multiplexer input channels.

The on-chip FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer can store up to 256 conversion results from the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview), which further reduces the system level power burden by allowing the  microcontroller to be in sleep mode for longer.  A convenient interrupt signal is then used to wake up the microcontroller when the data  exceeds a specified threshold indicating the FIFO has reached a  predefined number of samples (Watermark Mode), or the FIFO is full and  allows a “burst mode” data transfer.  This, combined with the smart  sequencer on the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) enables autonomous measurements to be made.

## A DC Coupled Solution for Biopotential Measurements

While it may not be obvious, the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) is a great example of a DC coupled solution for making single lead  biopotential measurements at low enough bandwidth levels such as heart  rate or even ambulatory ECG. Figure 3 shows a basic configuration where two analog inputs are tied to LA (left arm) and RA (right arm)  electrodes, and a third analog input is used to drive the body to a DC  Vbias of AVDD/2. While this is not a true Right Leg Drive (RLD) it may  be sufficient for battery powered solutions. Additionally, burnout  currents can be used as a spot check for DC lead off detection. Note  that with the available burnout current levels, these are better suited  to lower impedance/wetted electrodes. For dry electrode applications  where the input bias currents of the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) are too high, buffers such as the [ADA4505-2](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ada4505-2.html) or [MAX40024](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/amplifiers/MAX40024.html) could be placed at the electrodes prior to the [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview).

Figure 3 – Single Lead ECG configuration for the AD4130-8

Since this is a DC coupled input signal chain, the supply voltage and expected electrode offset must be considered when setting the gain of  the PGA to prevent saturation.  A table like the one shown in Figure 4  (Table 15 of the  [AD4130-8 Datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad4130-8.pdf) ) is a helpful way to track the noise for a given gain setting and  Output Data Rate (ODR). The ODR also sets the 3dB bandwidth for the  application as shown in the third column. The [AD4130-8](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad4130-8.html#product-overview) configuration has also been tested against the IEC60601-2-47  specification for ambulatory ECG and was able to pass all requirements  assuming an accurate enough external clock is used for the timing  accuracy test.
